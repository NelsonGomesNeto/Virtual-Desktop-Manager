# Virtual-Desktop-Manager (Windows Forms version)
A very simple key binder to emulate "Ctrl + Num" on Windows Virtual Desktops

## Something strange happened on System.Collections.ConcurrentDictionary
When I tryed to launch: some assembly bug happened; after running WPF version once: the problem is gone
I have no idea, but I will abandon Windows Forms and use only WPF

#### Huge thanks to this amazing wrapper: [Virtual Desktop](https://github.com/Grabacr07/VirtualDesktop)
