# Virtual-Desktop-Manager (Windows Forms version)
A very simple key binder to emulate "Ctrl + Num" on Windows Virtual Desktops

## Something strange happened on System.Collections.ConcurrentDictionary
When I tryed to launch: some assembly bug happened ("failed to compile com interfaces assembly the type concurrentdictionary"). If I had to guess, I would say it has something to do with my current Windows Insider version, but it's just a blind guess.
After running WPF version once: the problem is gone. I have no idea why this happened, but I will abandon Windows Forms and use only WPF

#### Huge thanks to this amazing wrapper: [Virtual Desktop](https://github.com/Grabacr07/VirtualDesktop)
